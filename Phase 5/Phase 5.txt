Phase 5 is the catch-all for assets, royalties and income streams.

Phase 5 is a charitable trust to be set up by the lawyers for my estate.

The trust is to be named, in Cree, "My son helping others" - or a variation chosen by his mother.  The lawyers will know how to contact her for naming the trust for our son.

Phase 5 is meant to be self-sustaining.  I would like all income streams, royalties etc, including any profits from renting the pastures (Phase 4) to be consolidate in a single charitable trust.

I would like the capital invested conservatively with a yearly payout.

Each year that yields a profit, I would like half re-invested in the trust so that it grows.  I would like the other half split 3 ways.

1 portion to be sent to the mother of my son for her lifetime (the lawyers will know)

1 portion to be sent to the strongest and most extraordinary woman I've ever met for her lifetime.  The woman that helped me survive my early 20s. (the lawyers will know)

1 portion to be donated to the food bank in Liverpool Nova Scotia for the duration of the trust in memory of my son.

In the event either or both women decline, or at the end of their lifetimes, those portions also go to the food bank in Liverpool Nova Scotia as donations in memory of my son.

Food is what my rapist weaponized.  Food is the first way she tried to kill her husband in 2018.  Food is how I want to honor my son's memory.
