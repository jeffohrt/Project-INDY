Project INDY is a 5 phase performance art piece designed to reflect and re-imagine my torture, mutilation and murder as altruistic events.  Project INDY is being set up to outlive me.

My death is imminent.  The goal of Project INDY Phase 1 is to keep me alive long enough to be deposed by lawyers and to be interviewed so the people that care can learn of all the things I've done in my life that are not permitted in my Dying Declaration.  My life has been short and busy.

I am not interested in charity or donations.  I stand on my own feet or I die.  I will sell the book rights to publishers who must arrange an author (ghost writer works on several levels) to interview me before my death and write the book (most likely after my death).

I will give top priority to Nova Scotia Publishers because of the ease of meeting the (ghost) author.

I was sex trafficked, kidnapped, held, tortured, mutilated and murdered.  All the details are in my Dying Declaration.  During the 2 year period (April 22nd 2017 to April 22nd 2019) that these events occurred my rapist collected a quarter of a million dollars in salary and pensions.  She made 250k raping and killing me because I brought her husband food (from the food bank).

I have split this figure in half - 120k for Phase 1 and 120k for Phase 2.

Whatever publisher wants my story, it is only available while I am alive and with an imminent death that won't be long.  Upon my death - if unsold - the book rights will be given away.

My last days need to be fun and distracting as I complete my Dying Declaration so as an homage to my favorite Richard Prior movie, we (the publishers, author and I) will Brewster's Millions my advance on the book.  That 120k will be used to keep me alive for as long as possible - to be interviewed.  Upon my death, the unspent balance will be returned to the publishers.

The 120k must be transferred to my account as soon as possible - first come first serve - no negotiating.  I don't have time and I'd rather give the rights away than haggle.  I had originally hoped clandestine meetings and briefcases of cash would be involved.  COVID kiboshed that idea.

Project INDY is performance art.  Phase 1 is an homage to Richard Prior but it must also reflect or re-imagine the events that lead to my death.

March 2017 started with sex trafficking (out of the Philippines).  The lies and manipulations that my rapist used to bring me across the planet involved having my siblings tell me I was being lent my childhood home; a safe place to be left alone for just a couple of months.  It never happened.

The first 5k will be spent pre-paying my rent until March 31st - that same 2 month time frame.  March 31st also works out well for several other artistic and logistical reasons.  The 5k minus rent - the rest is for paying my utilities and food.  This 2 month breather is to give my landlords some time and space in the event of my early death.  This 2 month breather is to give my friends some time to mourn before dealing with my possessions. ... in the event of my death sooner than expected.

I will pay my rent the second the bank transfer clears, if I die the next minute - the 115k that's left gets returned to the publishers and they still keep the book rights.  That's how this will work.

The ghost author can interview me at whatever interval they decide.  An imminent death means they should hurry and I am not travelling.  I don't live with people.  I don't let them in my home.  I need to feel safe and be left alone at home.  They can arrange their own housing.

Several of the murders I was subjected to involved withholding all medicines, doctors and medical attention.  I have 1 vial of medication that was used to lure me across the planet.  I have 1 vial of medication that I was forbidden from taking by my rapist under the threat my Uncle would be killed if I did.  This was one of many mutilating tortures that produced fatal injuries.

After paying my rent, I will make arrangements to take that medication.  If injected by Feb 1st, it will last until March 31st - March 31st is convenient for several artistic and logistical reasons.  This is one.  I have never taken this medication while having the intense seizures that were inflicted as part of murders 2 and 4.  There is a small chance it will kill me itself.

If I survive the medication, there is a surgery I require that my rapist denied me for 2 years and I haven't been able to afford or schedule thanks to COVID.  This surgery will require I be put under anesthetic.  I will lose between 4-6 teeth.  I currently only have 15.  I will need to have dentures made.  If I survive surgery, I will have trouble speaking for several days.

I am hoping, if I live long enough, I will recover from surgery before the end of Feb.  There is every chance I won't wake up from that surgery.  I go to bed every night not knowing if I will wake up.

During my captivity, particularly the 10 months of starvation and multiple murder attempts on my Uncle, all money for food, gas etc was withheld.  Money for operating a vehicle was withheld.  This is how I was trapped in the house, prevented from seeing people or getting food or help.  During my captivity I earned a small amount of money by hunting and trapping until my rapist destroyed all my trapping equipment and took food and gas money for the vehicle away.

If I am still alive, post surgery, I will take 15k to purchase and run an inexpensive car.  For the month of March, if I live, the author and I will trap.  I am a licensed trapper.  It will be a relaxing way to talk, in private, about the more serious events.  It is how I had some money to care for my Uncle.  When I die, in the woods, hunting and trapping is the top of my list.  Covered in molasses and left for the bears is a humorous 2nd place.

If I am still alive at the end of trapping season (March 31st) I will need to fly overseas to purchase additional medication.  Normally it costs 10k a year.  I am expecting twice that due to COVID expenses, flights, hotels etc.  My double vaccinations are done.  I am not eligible for my booster until mid March - so it all lines up if I live long enough.

The remaining 65k is to keep me alive, pay rent etc, while I try to finish Phase 2 of Project INDY.  Phase 2 is being setup through KickStarter - so that it survives my death regardless of when it happens or if the publishing industry tries to help.

The ghost author will remain involved for as long as they feel it is appropriate.
