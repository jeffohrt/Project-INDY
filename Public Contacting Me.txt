Social Media will never allow the details of my death on their platforms.

This is why I am using a repository.

Social Media will never allow discussions or debates surrounding the details of my death on their platforms.

This is why I have carved a corner out of reddit.

Any member of reddit can join : https://www.reddit.com/r/jeffohrt/

or just /r/jeffohrt

To discuss and debate whatever they like.

Play nice or get booted out.
