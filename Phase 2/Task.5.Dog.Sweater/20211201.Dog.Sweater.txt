While enjoying a meal with Families A and B - the topic of Ryker - the dog - not having a coat came up.

We had tried to find him one at the pet stores - but his weight (80 lb) combined with the stocky - tank like - build - meant nothing fit.

So we decided F*&*K it - I'll just knit him one.

A : "Of course you know how to knit !"

Jeff : "Yup - I crochet as well.  In fact - I've taught peeps to crochet all over the planet."

B : "Teach us to crochet ?"

Jeff : "Sure"

They tried, they succeeded ? they prefer to knit.

I decided to knit Ryker a sweater - there were no easily available, free, patterns in his size ... so F(*&K it again - I'll just crochet it.

It took a couple of visits - and a range of the ugliest colors I could scrounge from Family A & B's scraps and voila - a Dog Sweater for Ryker.
