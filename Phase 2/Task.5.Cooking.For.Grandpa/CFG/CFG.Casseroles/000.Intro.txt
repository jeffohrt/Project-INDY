Casseroles

There are an endless combination of ingredients leading to a 'casserole' at some point.

The basics are 3 layers.

BOTTOM

The bottom layer goes in first, hence first in the list.

The liquid, if any is added, or whatever comes out of the other ingredients, collects in the bottom. It is important to keep some liquid in the bottom to keep the casserole from burning. The bottom layer must be 'liquid tolerant'. As such, pre-cooked meat works well, as does potato or rice.

MIDDLE Goodness

The middle layer(s) are just that ... layers of goodness ... whether it be meat or vegetable or alternating layers of both.

TOP

The top layer goes on last, hence last in the list. It is usually but not always a starch; potatoes or rice. The main role of the top layer is to help keep the moisture in.

LIQUID

There's another layer. Liquid is needed. It can be water, milk or canned milk. Sometimes it is tomato (or other) soup poured over the top.

Light Casseroles → Bake at 350 °F (175 °C) for 60 to 90 minutes or until done.

Heavy Casseroles → Bake at 400 °F (200 °C) for 60 to 90 minutes or until done.

The net result is a goodness sandwich with starch top and bottom that is then steamed / baked in a liquid.
