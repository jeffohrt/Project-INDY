Corned Beef Hash

Not a hash at all - a casserole.

A staple from my father's parents and our 2 month summer camping trips.

Fry corned beef with onions and kernel corn to make the bottom layer

Make mashed potatoes and add as the 'second' layer.

Bake until hot through (it is already cooked) then add shredded cheese and bake until melted.
