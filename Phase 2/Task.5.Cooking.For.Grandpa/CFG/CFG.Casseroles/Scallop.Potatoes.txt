Scallop Potatoes

Another childhood staple.

Alternating layers of sliced potatoes and onions.

Canned milk for liquid, a bit of butter here and there if you like. You only need enough liquid to cover the first (bottom) 1/3 of the casserole. The rest will steam.

Grandma likes to bake it with the lid off for the last few minutes so the top layer browns up.

Au Gratin aka Fancy Scallop Potatoes

Alternating layers of sliced potatoes and onions.

The 'sauce' is a multiple of this ratio :

- 1 rnd Tablespoon of butter
- 1 rnd Tablespoon of flour
- 1 cup for milk
- 1 cup of cheese

Melt the butter and whisk/stir in the flour to prevent lumps.

Add the milk and simmer, stirring constantly, until everything thickens.

Add the cheese at the very end, stir in until melted.

Pour the whole thing over the potatoes, cover and bake.

Variations
----------

I lived with Sam, a German chap, in 2017/18 who insisted on putting apples, raisons and nutmeg in his fancy scallop potatoes.

Clan Brown / Mayo mix cream of mushroom soup with milk and add that to 50% or so of their scallop potatoes.
