Ringalls

A variation of a pancake I've seen all over the world. This particular recipe is from William Larkham Jr (Youtuber).

- finely diced onion, salt pork and meat

- mix up batter - 1 cup flour to 1 teaspoon of baking powder - add water until pancake batter

- mix everything together, tablespoon drop into a frying pan of hot bacon fat

- as they cook, flip and flatten to make hamburger patties
