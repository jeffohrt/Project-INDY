Potato Candy

Original recipes were ludicrously sweet - with a 10:1 powdered sugar to potato ratio.

I find 50/50 too sweet. But anyway - mix left over mashed potatoes (without the milk and butter) with your preference in terms of the amount of icing sugar.

→ Mix that adding potato, water or powdered sugar until it forms a putty like dough.

→ Put a layer of wax paper on a cookie sheet, sprinkle with powdered sugar and roll the dough out to a 1/4 inch thick

→ Leave the top bare or spread a thin layer of melted chocolate, a thin layer of peanut butter (or other nut butter) or even a thin layer of Nutello

→ Put it in the fridge to stiffen up a bit ... or while still warm, roll it and slice it like sticky buns.
