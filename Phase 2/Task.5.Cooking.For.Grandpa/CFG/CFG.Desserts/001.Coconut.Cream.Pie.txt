Coconut Cream Pie Base

1 cup sweetened shredded / flaked coconut

3 cups Blend (half-and-half)

2 eggs (beaten)

3/4 cup sugar

1/2 cup all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Heat the oven to 350, then turn off. Spread coconut on a cookie sheet and brown in cooling oven â€“ stir once or twice or until brown.

Bring to a boil on low heat, or in a double boiler (it is easier, but takes longer), simmer Blend, eggs, sugar and flour. Stir constantly and watch the edges / corners for flour lumps.

When it boils and is nice and thick remove from heat and stir in browned coconut and vanilla.

Pour into serving dishes and chill.
