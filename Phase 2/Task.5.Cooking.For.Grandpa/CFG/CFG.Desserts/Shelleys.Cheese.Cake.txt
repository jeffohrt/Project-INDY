Shelley's Cheese Cake

I went to public school with Shelley, from Gr 2 to 12 ... but it was my younger sister that fell madly in love with Shelley's favorite lunch item. A home-made cheese cake.

My sister would beg, borrow or steal anything to trade for some of the cheese cake. Shelley must have gone home and told her mother once or twice because one day Shelley came to school with the recipe. Her mother sent it to my mother, so my sister could have cheese cake.

→ 1 1/4 cups graham cracker crumbs

→ 1/4 cup of sugar

→ 1/4 cup of melted margerine (or butter)

Melt, mix and pat to fill a 9x13ish pan.

The 'crust' can be stiffened by placing it in the fridge or freezer until the butter sets.

→ 1 cup of sugar

→ 1 8 oz package of cream cheese (softened)

Mix in a bowl until creamy.

→ 1 large tub of Whip Cream

Fold in the whip cream.

Fill the crust with this mixture.

→ 1 can of pie filling

Cover the 'cheese cake' with a layer of pie filling. Cherry was always a favorite however my uncle loves Blueberry.

Dress it up a bit with Whip Cream if you like.

Chill in fridge until served.
