Cobbler & Grunt

Cobbler is a pie with a top but no shell / bottom. Hence it is more than pudding but less than a true and proper pie.

Grunt - as in blue berry grunt - is just a variation of a cobbler with dough boys instead of pastry.

mostly fill a standard casserole dish with fruit, sugar and spices as desired.

Apples - Some sugar and cinnamon

Strawberries - Some sugar

Peaches - Make a syrup with 1 cup of water and 1 cup of sugar. Bring to boil, reduce to simmer, dissolve sugar. Add peaches and simmer 2 minutes then remove from heat. DON'T COOK THE PEACHES.

Black Berries - Some sugar and lemon. A tablespoon or 2 of cornstarch and heat will thicken.

Blue Berries - Some sugar and lemon. A tablespoon or 2 of cornstarch and heat will thicken.
