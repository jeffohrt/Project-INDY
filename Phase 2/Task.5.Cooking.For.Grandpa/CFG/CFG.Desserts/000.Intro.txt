Coconut Cream Pie started it all

... and other desserts ...

It was a standing practice in the family, whenever the children "from away" came by, there would be a list of chores for us to do in exchange for our favorite foods.

As the cooks aged and arthritis set in, that shifted to us coming to do chores and bringing our favorite foods.

But when Grandpa's diet kicked in full strength even the favorite foods got banished.

Grandma had been making me mincemeat pies for 4 decades ... I had been bringing Grandpa coconut cream pies, his absolute favorite, for well over two decades when, in 2015, word on high came down ... no more pie ... too much salt ... blah blah blah ...

That is what started my cooking for Grandpa that summer - I needed to learn to make coconut cream pie filling, from scratch, with no salt.

It turned out to be easy so I set about teaching myself as much as I could ... with Grandpa making suggestions all the way along ... and that all ended in us writing a cookbook ... this cookbook.
