Rice Pudding Base

1 cup uncooked white rice

2 cups water

1 tablespoon butter / margarine

Add rice, water and butter to pot. Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer until water is absorbed â€“ about 20 minutes. Stir often.

2 cups of milk (divided)

1/3 cup sugar

1 egg

1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

1 cup of raisins

Add MOST but not all the milk when the water has been absorbed. Add sugar.

Simmer on low, stirring often, until milk is absorbed (15-20 minutes or until thick and creamy). Stir in the raisins towards the end to soak up the extra milk.

Beat egg into remaining milk, mix in vanilla. Pour into pudding and simmer for 2 minutes.

Pour into serving dishes and chill in the fridge.

Variations

I like NO sugar and cranberries instead of raisins.

Grandpa likes extra sugar, raisins and cranberries.

Substituting sweetened shredded coconut for sugar is also good.
