Rhubarb

Stewed (Fresh) Rhubarb

Wash and chop (into 1-2 inch pieces) fresh rhubarb.

Add water do not cover rhubarb.

Bring to a boil, reduce to simmer and simmer to desired consistency.

Stir in sugar to taste (over time).

* This can be frozen. As a kid I would stew and freeze rhubarb. It was a favorite to add over the top of ice-cream.

** Most recipes call for 'fresh' rhubarb (ie not stewed). If you wash, chop and dry off your rhubarb, you can freeze it in bags to use as 'fresh' rhubarb later. For convenience, I freeze it in 2 cup allotments as most recipes call for 2 cups which is now 1 bag.
