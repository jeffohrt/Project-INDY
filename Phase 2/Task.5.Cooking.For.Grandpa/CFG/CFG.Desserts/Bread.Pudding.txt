Bread Pudding Base

6-8+ slices of STALE / DRY bread

2 tablespoons of butter / margarine

4 eggs (beaten)

2 cups of milk

3/4 cup of sugar

1 teaspoon of cinnamon

1 teaspoon of vanilla extract

The bread needs to be stale / dry. Fresh bread does not cook up properly.

Mix everything except bread in the casserole dish you will bake it in (I am a one-pot-wonder). When well mixed, start adding bread.

Tear the bread into small pieces. Drop it in the liquid and mix well. Add bread until the liquid is absorbed or the casserole dish is 90% full.

Bake at 350 for 45 minutes.



Variations

Grandpa like extra raisins, I like no sugar.

Grandpa often has to use plain, no-salt, bread made especially for him.

I like making it from stale raisin bread.

Dried cranberries are good, as is substituting sweetened shredded coconut for sugar.
