My friends in BC excelled at sour dough.  Koko in particular always had a jar of it growing in her fridge.  She had things dialed in to the point it was just enough to make a sour dough loaf every Sunday.

Charley went on quite a sour dough kick and had it so dialed in she was trading sour dough for food and non-food items.
