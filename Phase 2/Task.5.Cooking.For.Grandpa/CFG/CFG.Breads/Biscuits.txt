My Grandpa Ohrt was an absolute master of making these biscuits in a cast iron frying pan over an open fire when we went camping as kids.

- 2 cups flour

- 1-2 tablespoon baking powder

- 1/2 cup shortening

Cut shortening in with a fork. Mix thoroughly until it resembles course crumbs.

- 3/4 cup milk

Mix in milk. Dough should be soft and slightly moist.

(add) Flour and work until soft and dry.

Roll into a 1/2 inch sheet and cut with a cookie cutter. Re-roll scraps and cut until consumed.

Pre-heat and bake on ungreased pan @450 °F or 230 °C until golden (about 10 min).



Variations
----------

- You can use 1:1 butter or margarine (85% fat) for shortening (100% fat) but the texture will be a bit off.

- Add all the fruits and nuts you like.

- Add a (packed) cup of cold, cooked, sweet potatoes.
