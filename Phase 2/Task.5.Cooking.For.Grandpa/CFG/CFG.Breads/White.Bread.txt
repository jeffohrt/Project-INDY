- 1 package or 2 teaspoons of dry yeast
- 2 cups of warm water
- 3 tablespoons of sugar

Mix and let stand somewhere warm to get the yeast going.

- 6 cups'ish of flour

Start adding flour, mixing with a spoon.  The dough will shift from soupy to pasty, to wet dough and finally a soft, stiff, dry, dough.

Kneed the dough for 10 min on a floured board.

Put the dough in a large oiled bowl and cover it with a towel and set it somewhere warm and draft-free to rise.

Let it double in volume - 1 to 1 1/2 hours

Punch it down, let it sit for 15 minutes, divide it into 2 equal halves.

Put each loaf (half) into a greased bread pan and let it rise (covered, warm, draft-free) until it doubles in volume or about an hour.

Bake at 375 F or 190 C for 30 min.

Crust should be golden brown and bread should sound hollow when tapped.

Variations
----------

Grandma says you always lightly butter the crust when done and still warm enough to melt butter.  I've seen many people do this.

All-Purpose Flour makes a denser, coarser loaf closer in appearance and texture to biscuits.
