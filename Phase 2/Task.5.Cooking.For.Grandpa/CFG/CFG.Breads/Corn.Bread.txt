Cornbread is another personal favorite. An old friend from college use to make me blueberry cornbread.

- 1/4 cup butter / margarine (melted)

- 1 cup milk

- 1 large egg

- 1 1/4 cups cornmeal

- 1 cup all-purpose flour

- 1/3 cup sugar

- 1 tablespoon baking powder

Mix everything together. Spoon into greased muffin pan, fill each cup 1/2 to 2/3 full. Bake at 350 for 20 to 30 min, use the toothpick test to check when they are done.


Variations
----------

More sugar for Grandpa, less for me.

Add berries, raisins or dried cranberries as desired.

Add 1 cup fresh chopped rhubarb, 1/2 cup extra sugar.



Very Variations
---------------

Double everything, mix everything except flour until smooth. Add and mix in flour as little as possible to reduce gluten formation. Pour into a well greased cast iron pan and bake on 400 F for 25-30 min.

The following was requested by Grandpa so often, I added it to the book on principal.
