Roti Canai : Malaysian Flat Bread
---------------------------------

- 4 cups of flour

- 1 egg

- 3 tablespoons of melted butter (or oil)

- 1 tablespoon of condensed milk (optional)

- 1 - 1 1/4 cup of water

Mix everything into a smooth dough, not too sticky but not dry either.

Some peeps say it is important to kneed for 10 min and rest for 10 min

Oil up a bowl, oil up your hands, roll the dough into palm sized balls. Some peeps use butter, not oil.

Cover them with a lid or saran wrap and let them sit overnight.

The next day, oil up your hands, take a ball and kneed it out to dinner plate size. Flip, twirl and stretch it like pizza dough. You want it paper thin.

It often helps to coat it in oil or butter as you stretch it thinner and thinner.

Fold it into halves at least 3 times. Put goodness in each layer if you like.

Fry it in a pan with oil until golden brown.
