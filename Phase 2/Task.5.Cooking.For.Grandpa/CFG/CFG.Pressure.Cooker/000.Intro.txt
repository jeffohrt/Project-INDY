In Jan 2020 I bought a pressure cooker, a bit of a knock-off Instant Pot. It still amazes me how many people are terrified of a pressure canner but happily told me how awesome their Instant Pot was. It's the same device, goes to the same pressures etc.

Anywho - enough people were impressed with the new pressure cookers that I finally got one on a Black Friday sale.

It's digital, fully programmable and comes with who knows how many preprogrammed things.

I'm more of a trial and error person. That and I never do the same thing the same way twice - not cooking anyway. So I set about learning to use the pressure cooker by using the pressure cooker.

After a year of playing around - the pressure cooker turns out to be overrated. It's quite good for thawing something out in a hurry - but items like pulled pork (or other meats) are simply better done in a crockpot over a longer time.

Braising is braising and pressure doesn't seem to help.
