My pressure cooker was the 6 quart model - big enough for a 4 lb chicken - but laughably too small for the 10 lb chickens we butchered.

My friends picked up an 8 quart model that has an air fryer attachment.

That is hands down the only way we do chickens now.

It takes a little coaxing, dismembering of legs and wings, to fit a 10 lb chicken in an 8 quart air fryer / pressure cooker.

It's worth its weight though. Best birds (chicken and duck) we've done.
