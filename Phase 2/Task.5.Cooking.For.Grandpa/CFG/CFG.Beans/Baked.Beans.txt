Baked Beans

Another of my childhood favorites is baked beans. The first and arguably greatest compliment I have ever gotten was my grandmother having second helpings of my beans and then putting all the leftovers in the fridge with her leftovers (those are separate from the other leftovers).

Old School vs Quick(ish)

Old School

- rinse beans
- cover with lots of water
- soak out for at least 12 hrs
- change water at least twice

Add the GOODNESS

Bake at 250 F for 5-6 hrs

or

Cook on High in a crockpot for 8-10 hrs.

*** I've always found oven baked beans better.



Quick'ish

- rinse beans
- cover with water
- rolling boil for an hour

A water change or 2 will help - but takes longer as water must come back to boiling

Due a complete water change.

Add the GOODNESS

Simmer for 2 - 3 hrs.




Proportions

Place your quantity of dried beans in the cooking container. This is roughly 1/4 the final volume.

A proper soak will double the volume of the beans.

The goodness adds even more.

Typical for my family

A large crockpot can cook a 900g bag of dried beans to completion. It's less than 1/2 full when soaking and more than 2/3 full when done.

The GOODNESS

No matter what you are adding, bring the liquid level to just below the beans. Add a little more during cooking if you like but not too much. Soupy beans are not that great.

Bacon or Pork Fat to taste

Alternate Corned Beef - excellent - family didn't like it.

Alternate Hotdogs - did not work out

Molasses or Maple Syrup to taste

Ketchup, Tomato Soup, Spaghetti Sauce, BBQ Sauce

Some, most or ALL - fill your boots.

Mustard powder or just yellow mustard

Alternate fancy mustards - I like the multi-colored seedy mustards.
