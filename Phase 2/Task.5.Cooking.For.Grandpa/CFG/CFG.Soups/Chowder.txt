Chowder Base

- wash, peel and dice potato (this is 2/3 the vol of finished chowder)

- simmer until potato is almost done, dice an onion or two, add and simmer until potato and onion are done

- minimize water, just enough to barely cover potato

Corn Chowder

- add cream corn, simmer and mix well
- some peeps fry bacon and add

Clam, Seafood, Lobster or Fish Chowder
	
- fry seafood in bacon, add to base, simmer and mix well

- simmer and mix well keeping liquid to a minimum

At this point it's 'soup' and will freeze well. You can add cream, simmer and serve. I like to refrigerate, taking just enough for a meal, heating it, adding cream and eating just that. By limiting the cream to when you heat just what you want, it keeps longer in the fridge.

I have an uncle that adds butter when he adds cream.
