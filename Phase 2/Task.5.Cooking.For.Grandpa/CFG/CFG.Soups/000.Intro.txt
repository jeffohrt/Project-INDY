Soups, Stews and Chowders

Soups and Stews - everything you like in a pot, add water, go, go, go.

The truth is not far off that. The only real variation is water vs stock (meat or veg) and the order things are put in and boiled or simmered. The goal is for everything to be finished together and as crunchy or soft as peeps desire.

The difference between a soup and stew is the amount of liquid. Soups have a broth while stews are more of a gravy. Chowders use a cream or milk.
