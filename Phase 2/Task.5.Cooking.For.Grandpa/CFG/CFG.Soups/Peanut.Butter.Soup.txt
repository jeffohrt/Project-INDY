West African Peanut Soup or Stew

Random person at a fav coffee shop told me about this in 2019. Looked it up, tried it out and added it to the book.

*** Tried this once - sweet potato and peanut butter are crazy over-powering. Dial it back a bit.

Some peeps start by dicing and pan frying chicken.

- bring water or stock to a boil, add diced onion, grated ginger and garlic for a soup

... add diced sweet potato for a stew

- simmer for 15-20 min

- add peanut butter

- add chopped tomato (soup) or tomato paste (stew) or both

- stir well

- add veg (as desired - kale is very good, as are bell peppers)

- simmer until veg are cooked

- add hot sauce to taste, sprinkle with chopped peanuts as it is plated
