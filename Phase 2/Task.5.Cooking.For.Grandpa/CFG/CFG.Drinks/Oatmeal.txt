Oatmeal

- 8 cups of water

- 1 cup of oats (quick-cooking is ok)

- 1 cinnamon stick

- 1/4 - 1/2 cup of sugar

- 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract

- Blend the oats, cinnamon and water in a blender for a minute or 2

Some peeps do all the oats and cinnamon with 4 cups of water, decant (or strain) off the liquid, add fresh water and blend again, decanting (straining) a second time. Solids can be added back in if you like.

Some peeps do all the oats and cinnamon with all 8 cups ... blending and decanting to reduce solids as much as possible.

I normally just blend it all up and call it good.
