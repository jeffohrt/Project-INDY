Curry

I can't recall having ever had curry growing up and I'm certain I've not made one for the family. It is a true favorite though. Mutton / Lamb curry ... I have had jobs in Malaysia and the Middle East where I eat at the little blue collar restaurants 4 nights a week just to have mutton curry each time.

My partner in Malaysia taught me to make curry, though hers was far better.

The first time I had curried crab (whole crabs in the curry) was in Malaysia with a friend and his family from Korea. The single messiest dinner I have ever had. We needed rain gear and had to take showers when we were done. But good !!!

I make all my curries the same way (depending on what's available) and only switch up the meat / veg option. Seafood still rules.

With a focus on one-pot-wonders, and my inherent efficiency (laziness), I do appreciate the pre-made curry pastes. Takes so much of the unpleasant work out of making wonderful curries.
