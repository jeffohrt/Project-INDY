Curry Base

- brown up meat / seafood in a little oil

- in the case of 'in the shell' shellfish, crabs or such ... I steam them with the lid on and then reduce the water as best I can to save the goodness

- saute a diced onion, ginger and garlic with meat / seafood, a little more oil maybe

- throw in veg to your hearts' content (peeled if you like, chopped to size)

- Simmer to taste / thickness of broth.

Add CURRY PASTE either pre-made or from scratch ... and some coconut milk
