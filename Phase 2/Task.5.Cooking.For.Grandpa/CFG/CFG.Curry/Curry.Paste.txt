Pre-Made Curry Pastes

Complete pastes come in a 'brick' like a chocolate bar. I break off 1 or 2 small squares for a small curry (good for me for 2 or 3 large meals) ... or more for larger pots ... this is a 'to taste' experience thing

Throw paste into CURRY BASE, bring to desired volume using a mix of water and coconut milk. More water is a thinner, more coconut milk is a thicker finished curry. I usually do 50:50.

Mix paste in well, simmer / reduce to thickness, enjoy

In 2021 Charley and I tried a pre-made curry paste I wasn't familiar with.  A little jar of the stuff.  It made more of a hodgepodge than a veg curry.  It was good - but I'll stick with my curry paste bars in the future.





Curry Paste from Scratch

add 3 parts lemon or lime juice

add 1 part curry spice (paste) ('raw' or unflavored)

add 1 part brown sugar (or less ... I like less)

add herbs and spices to taste

For a small curry I would use teaspoons, for a large curry tablespoons, for a massive affair maybe cups ? Experience will tell you, maybe start with a small curry and teaspoons the first time.

Mix everything in well, tasting and modifying as you go

Simmer / reduce to thickness

Add to - or make in - CURRY BASE - add in some coconut milk and / or water.

Simmer, reduce, enjoy.
