During my captivity (2017-2019) I was not permitted to hunt or trap for food and money.  I was forced to go to the food bank to feed my Uncle for 10 months while I starved, losing 1/3 of my body weight and developing the seizures that are my 4th terminal medical condition.

My rapist regularly searched the house for food - stealing and destroying what she found.

This was done to me as a child as well - my grandfather taught me to smoke, salt and pickle food - so I could cache it in places the adults couldn't find it.

I had to use these skills again in 2017-2019.

Bottling meat is one of several ways I store food without refridgeration.

Family A was an instant fan of my 'pork and rice' - which was salt pork, bottled, so I could keep it in a cupboard.

Or in 2018 - hide it in the basement, garage, tractor shed, crawl spaces and at times - stone walls.

We bottled a lot of meat.  Mostly pork, some fish, some bear and on a particularly good day - we boned out 100 lbs of beef shank - which I got for 90 cents a lb.
