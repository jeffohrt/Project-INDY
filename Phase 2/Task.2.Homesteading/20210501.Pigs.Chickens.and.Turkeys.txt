In 2021 we (Family A, B and I) expanded the livestock program to 3 pigs, 12 chickens and 6 turkeys.

The 3 pigs were all males, and organically named Big Pig, Little Pig and Middle Pig.

Big Pig, named for his size, was the Big Lebowski of pigs.
Middle Pig loved cake.
Little Pig - had the pig version of kennel cough - we were advised to just put him down.  We kept him.  He grew slowly at first and was the last to cross the 100 lb mark - but once he did - he started catching up to Middle Pig.

No one caught up to Big Pig.

Little Pig was the hateful one this year.

All 3 pigs fought like brothers.

The pigs this year were vegetarians.  They did not like fish in their slops.  They did figuratively fight to the death for potatoes and left over pastries.  They also loved apples.  We must have picked 20-25 5 gallon buckets of windfall / drop apples off the ground to give to them.

They really loved apples.

The chickens were a learning curve.  All 12 showed up as day olds.  When the males hit 8 lbs they were mature enough to begin fighting each other.

The first drop of blood - and the turkeys would kill them.

We butchered the male chickens early - after learning this.

The turkeys left the female chickens alone.  They hit 10 lbs butchered.

The turkeys also did very well this year.
