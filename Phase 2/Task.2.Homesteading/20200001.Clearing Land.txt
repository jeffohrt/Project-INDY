During my captivity - I was not allowed to work.  I was threatened and beaten, my Uncles threatened and beaten, and worse - if I left Beach Meadows or took any form of employment.

In 2020 I was given the opportunity to address this.  A young family I met while I "lived" in a coffee shop owned and lived on a parcel of land just under 1 acre in size in a neighboring community.

The front yard bordered the road and is the septic field for the house.

The backyard was completely wooded.  They wanted this 1/2 acre cleared so they could enjoy their backyard and their son could enjoy the backyard.

From April 2020 to the summer of 2021 I helped them clear their property of blow-downs (dead and dangerous trees) as well as undesirable trees.

We cleared roughly 1/2 an acre.
