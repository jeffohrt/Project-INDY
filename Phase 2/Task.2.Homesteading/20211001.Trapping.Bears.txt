During my captivity (2017-2019) I was not permitted to hunt or trap for food and money.  Task 2 - in 2020 I began trading labor for hunting and trapping access to Family B's 30 acres.

The Families (A and B) had a much better sense of my sense of humor - and trapping went much better this year.  We took 2 bears in October.  A 350lb one and a 250 lb one.

The wife in Family A is a culinary graduate - and an excellent butcher.

We found out no one, except me, enjoys the stronger gamey taste of the larger bear.  We found out that the smaller bear was better for food - but other than me - no one really went out of their way to eat bear.

We did a few "pulled bear" roasts - like pulled pork - except bear - that were excellent.
