The 2020 Pigs were named organically - Male and Female.

Both pigs had the run of the back yard and excelled at digging up everything.

Both came to the backyard fire pit and would sleep next to us while the fire was going.

Male Pig, in particular, loved having his belly scratched.  He would roll over and offer up his belly for just such a thing.

Female Pig was hate incarnate.  She picked on the wife and son of the family quite a bit.

Both pigs took out (serious knee injury) a visitor who believed experience with beef cows translated to pigs.  It did not.

The turkeys grew exponentially - they were named for the characters on Rick and Morty.

The dog took to chasing the turkeys.  Summer ran into the house and killed herself.

Jerry - the biggest tom - was 50 lbs, when he went in the oven for Thanks Giving.  He had a bad habit of attacking the then 5 year old.
