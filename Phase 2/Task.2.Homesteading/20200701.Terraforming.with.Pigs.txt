During my captivity I was starved for 10 months - losing 1/3 of my body weight and developing the seizures that are my 4th terminal medical issue.
During my captivity I was banned from hunting and trapping as a food and money resource.

Task 1 and 2 led to helping these 2 families (A and B) with both those options.

With the success of Tasks 1 and 2 - the 2 families (A and B) and I decided to pool resources and raise Cows (Beef), Pigs and Turkeys.

Initially we contacted a third family (C) - to exchange labor for pasture access to raise cows and pigs on pasture.

That started in June 2020 but within a month - Family C couldn't locate beef cattle for sale (neither could we) and was overwhelmed with the 3 pigs.  Family C asked us to come get our 2 pigs.

Family A and I were in the middle of house / bathroom renovations and had to drop everything to build animal housing and enclose the back 1/2 acre of their property in 5 strand solid wire electrical fencing - to keep bears out and pigs, turkeys and a dog in.

It never did keep the turkeys in - they are magically resistant to electric fencing.

The pigs and dog learned quickly to respect the fence.

The bears did not enjoy the fence.  They stopped one day - to glare at us from under the apple tree - because they had encountered the fence, at the back of the property, while standing ankle deep in water.

Fence : 1
Bears : 0

Raising Pigs and Turkeys was a success.
