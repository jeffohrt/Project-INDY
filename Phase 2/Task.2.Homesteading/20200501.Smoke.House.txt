During my captivity (2017-2019) I was not permitted to hunt or trap for food and money.  I was forced to go to the food bank to feed my Uncle for 10 months while I starved, losing 1/3 of my body weight and developing the seizures that are my 4th terminal medical condition.

My rapist regularly searched the house for food - stealing and destroying what she found.

This was done to me as a child as well - my grandfather taught me to smoke, salt and pickle food - so I could cache it in places the adults couldn't find it.

I had to use these skills again in 2017-2019.

In 2020 Family A asked if we could smoke the pigs we were raising.  I said sure, and we built a 4' x 4' x 8' smoke house.

Since we cold smoke (preservation - not cooking) everything - we built the fire pit 10' away, and in the ground.  We piped the smoke to the house to let it cool.

We broke in the smoke house in 2020 with 300 kiacks - my favorite fish.  We did another 80 as well.

We smoked pork hams and bacon in 2020.

We smoked pork and bear hams and bacon in 2021.

The 2021 bacon was an instant success and we traded it for quite a few things - including some deer meat.

The smoke house continues to be handy - as we smoke hides with the fire pit.
