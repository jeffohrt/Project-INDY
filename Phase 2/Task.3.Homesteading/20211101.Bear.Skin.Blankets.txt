Families A and B and I were hunting and trapping together.

Family B wanted a bear skin rug because they were afraid of the bears on their property.

Family A wanted a bear skin blanket because they wanted a bear skin blanket.

The Families did the work.  I'd done leather work of this type since my childhood.

The smaller bear was fleshed in 8 hrs.  The larger bear took closer to 12 hrs.

We used a standard TAWing process - using aluminum sulphate and salt.  Aluminum sulphate can be bought at any hardware store - it's rose (the flower) fertilizer.

We used a synthetic BRAIN TANning process - using egg yolks, Dawn dish soap and a little water.

We smoked the hides in Family A's backyard - where we built the smoker.
