During my captivity (2017-2019) I was not permitted to hunt or trap for food and money.  Task 2 - in 2020 I began trading labor for hunting and trapping access to Family B's 30 acres.

The family was just getting to know me and my sense of humor.  Trapping was put off too late and we didn't trap any bears in 2020.  Saw lots though.

I even got an honorable mention in a wildlife photography competition (Trail Cameras only).
