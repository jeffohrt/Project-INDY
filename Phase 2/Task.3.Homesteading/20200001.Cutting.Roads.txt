The successful undertaking of Task 1 - led to Task 2 - with another family.

This family owned 30 acres with 25 acre or more as fully forested.  There were logging roads that weaved on and off the property.

This family wanted the roads (roughly 2 km of roads) maintained (cleared - chainsaw work) and connected (falling - chainsaw work) so the owner did not have to leave her property to use the new road to drive the length of her property.

This was begun in the fall of 2020 in exchange for hunting and trapping access.  It continues to the present.
