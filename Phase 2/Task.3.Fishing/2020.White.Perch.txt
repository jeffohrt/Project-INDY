In 2020 Family A and I found some nice white and yellow perch locations.  There were a few pickerel and a few catfish thrown in.

A few small bass here and there.  My favorite bass river got 'modified' to a 'trophy' area or some such - the daily limit was reduced to 3 (not 5) and the size limit was reduced to only 1 bigger than 14 inches.

Bass - for food - just weren't chasing.

The husband in Family A - managed to catch freshwater mussels - repeatedly.
