In 2017 I went feathering for mackerel - that's a style of commercial fishing that lobster fishermen were allowed to use in 2017.

They are still allowed (2021) just the licensing and rules have changed a little.

Lobster fishermen catch literal tons of mackerel as bait.

During lobster season, mackerel as bait, can cost as much as $1 a pound.  In the summer, as long as the cost of the boat, crew - freezing and storing mackerel, bring the price below that - it is worth it to the fishermen to catch their own bait.

My Uncles and I went - and were paid in Mackerel each day.
