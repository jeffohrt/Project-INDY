During my captivity (2017-2019) I was not permitted to hunt or trap for food and money.  I was forced to go to the food bank to feed my Uncle for 10 months while I starved, losing 1/3 of my body weight and developing the seizures that are my 4th terminal medical condition.

My rapist regularly searched the house for food - stealing and destroying what she found.

This was done to me as a child as well - my grandfather taught me to smoke, salt and pickle food - so I could cache it in places the adults couldn't find it.

I had to use these skills again in 2017-2019.

When discussing with Family A - what were the best things I showed them - it's a tie.

It use to be the pork and rice - salted and bottled pork - until the culinary wife complained about the price of salt beef.

When I explained the salt beef - for boiled dinners, stews etc - was just beef brisquet, some pink salt and normal salt - when I showed them that with 50 lbs of cheap brisquet - it instantly became the best thing I'd ever done.
