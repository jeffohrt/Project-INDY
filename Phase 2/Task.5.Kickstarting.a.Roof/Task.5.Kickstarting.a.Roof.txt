Project INDY Phase 2 Task 5 - 25k for a roof for a young family

March 2017 started with sex trafficking (out of the Philippines).  The lies and manipulations that my rapist used to bring me across the planet involved having my siblings tell me I was being lent my childhood home; a safe place to be left alone for just a couple of months.  It never happened.

A young family with a young child has helped me immensely, for 2 years, without knowing who or what I was or what I was facing.  They need a roof for their home (20 ft x 40 ft = 800 sq ft) and garage (20 ft x 30 ft = 600 sq ft).

The total of 1400 sq ft, at $10 / sq ft in raw materials (https://canadianmetalroofing.ca/) puts the raw materials at 14k.  The other 11k is for a COVID buffer - some things are very expensive.  The roof substructure, for both buildings, will also need to be repaired in spots.  The house was built in the 1940s.

The 25k is for the materials (steel roof).  If I were to live long enough - I would like to arrange a roof building party - like a barn raising - to reflect the 2 years of captivity I was not allowed to speak to neighbors or ask for help.  If I don't live long enough, I would like them to have the materials so they can arrange the party after I am gone.
