Project INDY Phase 2 Task 6 - 25k for a roof for a young family

March 2017 started with sex trafficking (out of the Philippines).  The lies and manipulations that my rapist used to bring me across the planet involved having my siblings tell me I was being lent my childhood home; a safe place to be left alone for just a couple of months.  It never happened.

A young family with a young child has helped me immensely, for 2 years, without knowing who or what I was or what I was facing.  They need a roof for their home (20 ft x 40 ft = 800 sq ft) and garage (20 ft x 30 ft = 600 sq ft).

If I were to live long enough - I would like to arrange a roof building party - like a barn raising - to reflect the 2 years of captivity I was not allowed to speak to neighbors or ask for help.  I've re-shingled and repaired roofs with my grandfather in the 1980s as well as for several families in 2019 / 2020.

If I don't live long enough, I would like them to have the materials so they can arrange the party after I am gone.

The performance art component - is the act of gathering the neighbors together to build / repair a roof.  This isn't done any more.  It should be.  It will only take a couple of days with rotating volunteers doing the labor and cooking the food as we throw a BBQ and fix a roof.

This finished product for the backers are the photos and videos.


The total of 1400 sq ft, at $10 / sq ft in raw materials (https://canadianmetalroofing.ca/) puts the raw materials at 14k.

In Feb 2022, Kickstarter has it's own spreadsheet accounting option, that I can't get to work.  But I can use their numbers.

Raw Materials (my numbers) :     14,000

Labor (my numbers) :                  0 - I want a "Roof Building Party" of volunteers

Safety Buffer (Kickstarter 20%) : 2,800

Kickstarter Commission (5%) :       700
Payout Fees (5%) :                  700


Canadian Income Tax (25%) :       4,550


Total :                          22,750

I've rounded up to 25k for a nice even number.
