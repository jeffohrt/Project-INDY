In May and June of 2020 I took Charley, her son and some friends Shad fishing in the valley (Nova Scotia - Annapolis Valley).

We were successful, bringing our limits home each time.

Many people fish for years before getting their first shad.  Charley hooked and lost many in June - when the shads' mouthes get softer.

Charley had many National Geographic level jumping fish - and got to see the chaos and danger of competing with other shad fishermen.

She landed her first shad on our last trip - a 5-6 lber.
